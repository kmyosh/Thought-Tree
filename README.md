### _Even your worst ideas can have merit. Thought-tree intends to be a database for all your half-baked, underdeveloped thoughts that you can come back to and add ideas onto, and redevelop. Who says you need to start from scratch?_

### Next Steps\*

- Responsive display, would be nice to have a mobile-friendly app.
- display username, timestamps for ideas.
- have other users be able to connect your 'thoughts' into 'ideas'. Essentially, you connect multiple "thoughts" into one "idea" that can
  become a catalyst for creativity.
